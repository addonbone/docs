**AddonBone** is a cross-browser web extension framework that empowers you to build and maintain multiple browser extensions from a single, unified code base. Whether you need different localizations, icons, or designs, AddonBone lets you deliver production-ready extensions with consistent core functionality — without duplicating your work.

## **Core Principles**

- **Single Code Base:** Develop and manage all your extensions using one set of source files, streamlining updates and maintenance.
- **Flexible Project Structure:** Supports both monorepos (multiple extensions in one repository) and standalone projects, so you can organize your code your way.
- **Modern Development Workflow:** Automatically merges styles, scripts, content scripts, and background logic for each extension, saving you time and reducing errors.

## **Before You Begin**

This documentation assumes you’re already familiar with the basics of browser extension structure and know how to interact with extension APIs.

<Card title="New to browser extensions?" icon="sparkles">
  If you’ve never built an extension before, start with Chrome’s [<u>Hello World tutorial</u>](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/) to create a simple extension without AddonBone. Once you’re comfortable, come back here to level up your workflow.
</Card>

It’s also a good idea to keep the [Chrome extension docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/) and [Mozilla’s extension documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) handy. AddonBone doesn’t change how you use browser APIs, so you’ll often refer to these resources for specific features.
