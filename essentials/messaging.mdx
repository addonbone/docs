# Messaging

[Chrome Docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/messaging/) â€¢ [Firefox Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime#messaging)

Read the docs linked above to learn more about using the vanilla messaging APIs.

## Alternatives

The vanilla APIs are difficult to use and can be a pain point for many new extension developers. For this reason, Addon Bone recommends installing an NPM package that wraps around the vanilla APIs.

Here are some popular messaging libraries that support all browsers and work with Addon Bone:

- **trpc-chrome**: tRPC adapter for Web Extensions.
- **webext-bridge**: Messaging in WebExtensions made super easy. Out of the box.
- **@webext-core/messaging**: Lightweight, type-safe wrapper around the Web Extension messaging APIs.
- **@webext-core/proxy-service**: A type-safe wrapper around the Web Extension messaging APIs that lets you call a function from anywhere, but execute it in the background.
- **Comctx**: Cross-context RPC solution with type safety and flexible adapters.
